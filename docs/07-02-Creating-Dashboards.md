# Dashboards in Caplena

Dashboards allow you to visually report your data and research findings. In a dashboard you can combine and prioritize different data selections from a single question, from several questions within one projects as well as across all projects of your project library.

**The key topics of this article are:**

- How to create and access dashboards
- What dashboard elements are available and how to use them
- How to use filters to look at specific sub-groups of your data
- How to share dashboards within and outside your organization

## Create and Access Dashboards

Dashboards can be created and accessed from the *Cockpit* within a single project or from your dashboard library where all dashboards across all your projects are stored.

The following screenshot shows the dashboard list for an individual project. You can select existing dashboards from the list or create a new one by clicking the *New Dashboard* link at the bottom right:

You can access your dashboard library, where all your dashboards across all your projects are being stored, via the main menu on the top left. Here you can either open the list and select existing dashboards or create a new one be clicking on the menu item *New*.

## Dashboard Elements

Dashboard creation starts on a blank whiteboard-type screen that you can populate easily with data and text elements. When you click on any blank space on your dashboard, you can chose between the following three dashboard elements.

![Bildschirmfoto 2022-06-13 um 18.55.32.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEyNDcxMw/images/xPnHC2azOCs)

Lets have a look at each of the three elements individually and how they can be used.

### Existing Charts

By clicking on Existing Charts you will go straight to your chart library where you can select any chart that you have created before. When the chart appears in your dashboard you can change size and position with your mouse and you can also edit the chart content - the screenshot below shows you where to do that.

![Ohne Titel.jpg](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEyNDcxMw/images/4g17ylaWPls)

- **Chart Position**: Charts can be dragged freely across the dashboard by grabbing the chart with your mouse at the top left of the chart - just keep the mouse clicked and move it across.

- **Chart Size**: To change height and width of the chart you simply grab the chart with your mouse at the bottom right and you can open the chart to your preferred size.

- **Edit Your Chart**: By clicking on the edit icon on the top right of the chart, you will go straight into the Chart Setup where you can make changes, such as apply filters, manipulate the font size of the data labels or the color scheme. However, please be aware that once saved, the "original" chart will be changed accordingly - so in case you want to keep the "original" chart or it is also being used in another dashboard where it should not be changed, you might want to create a copy of the chart before overwriting the settings of the "original" one.

All charts are **interactive**, which means that **you can click on any chart element to see which texts lie behind the topics or categories** and a mouse-over shows you details on sample size, full data labels etc.

### Text Elements
Text elements can be used to structure your dashboard or to add interpretations. For your texts you can choose between a bold type face for headings or short texts and a non-bold type face for longer interpretations and explanations. The color of font and background can be changed with a seamless color pallet, but you can also enter RGB codes to match your company's color scheme.

The following example shows two text boxes, one acts as a heading to mark a dashboard section and the other can be used to insert interpretations and comments.

### Verbatim Sample
This feature allows you to show open-ended responses from a particular question. You can also apply filters to show a particular code or category overall or within a particular segment, i.e. the most frequent code / category or a code / category which is under particular observation within your organization filtered by country, location, business unit or else.

The following example shows all open ended comments that fall into the most frequent code. Each response will be shown together with the assigned code and you can scroll through all responses that match the filter.

## How to Use Filters

You can apply filters to any individual chart allowing you to look at a specific sample selection. The available filters are defined by the data that you have uploaded together with your open-ended questions. However, in case there are variables missing that you would like to use for your analysis, with our Add or replace additional columns function, you can easily add further variables to your data. Click here for a help article explaining how to upload additional data columns.

There is also a function to apply filters for the entire dashboard, which you can be found at the top left of the dashboard page.

![Bildschirmfoto 2022-02-03 um 18.53.50.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEyNDcxMw/images/E0mmYES2sHU)

By clicking on *Add Filter* you will be able to choose freely from the available variables, e.g, any variable that you have uploaded together with your open ended data. In the case below - a demo data set about the satisfaction with mobile carriers - you can select various smart phone brands to filter the entire dashboard by one or several brands.

![Bildschirmfoto 2022-02-03 um 18.56.54.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEyNDcxMw/images/mTOGz9ATaz4)

You can always see whether or not you are looking at filtered data. If the data is filtered, there will be an indication next to Add Filter. In case the data label is too long, a simple mouse-over will show you the details. 

In the example below the dashboard is filtered by a single variable ("1 selected"), which is the Apple brand.

![Bildschirmfoto 2022-02-03 um 19.02.23.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEyNDcxMw/images/aPMLlLztd7s)

Filters can be removed by clicking the circled cross on the left of the filter.

## Dashboard Sharing

Dashboards are accessible by other Caplena users within your organization depending on their role and permission. 

However, you can also share your dashboards via shareable link with anyone; independent of whether they have a Caplena account or not. To share your dashboard you simply select Enable shareable link at the top right of your dashboard page.

![Bildschirmfoto 2022-02-04 um 12.17.27.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEyNDcxMw/images/cXr1ZWE9lVU)

Once the shareable link is enabled, you can copy the URL of the dashboard by clicking on *Copy URL*. Here you have two options:

- **Copy shareable URL**: Sharing the dashboard as it is.
- **Copy shareable URL with filters**: Sharing the dashboard with any filter you may have applied, so that the recipient can see the filtered data. The recipient will be able to turn off the filters and look at the entire data as well.

![Bildschirmfoto 2022-02-04 um 12.20.28.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEyNDcxMw/images/RB8xmseMvOw)

The recipient will have access to the dashboard with its full interactivity, which means they can zoom into the categories and read the open-ended comments behind each chart element and they can use the overall dashboard filters to drill into particular segments. However, they will not be able to edit, add or replace any of the dashboard elements.
