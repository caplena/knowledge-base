# Importing Multiple Texts to Analyze in one Project

When starting a project, you have either a single column with text to analyze or you have several text columns in one row. The latter is often true when analyzing survey data with several open-ended questions.

## One Text Column to Analyze

In case you are analyzing the answers to a single open-ended question from a survey, reviews from a customer review website (such as Google Maps, Apple App Store, Amazon, etc.) or social media feedback, you will have a project with a single text-column to be analyzed. Thus, you simply upload your open-ended data together with your auxiliary data columns (these can be any additional variables such as ID, ratings, demographics, dates, countries, etc.) that you like to use for analysis, filtering, and segmentation.

## Multiple Texts to Analyze

When analyzing survey data, you might have more than one open-ended question in your questionnaire. In such cases, you do not have to create several individual projects to analyze them across different individual projects, you can import your data all at once as a single file.

The example below includes two open-ended questions as well as several auxiliary variables for analytical purposes.

Using this approach makes only sense when you have your data organized like in the example above, i.e., in one sheet in which each row represents one respondent.

Despite having all questions within one project, the actual analysis will take place on an individual text level. All text columns / questions will be shown when accessing your project.
