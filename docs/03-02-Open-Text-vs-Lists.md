# Open Text versus Semi-Open / List Text

Depending on your text to analyze, Caplena offers two different solutions to catagorize your data.

- **Open text** leaves room for a broad spectrum of topics, often including sentiment & emotions and usually consists of sentences or phrases.
- **Semi-open / list text** has a narrower scope, it is closer to a collection of keywords and often delivers a list or an enumeration.

## Why are there two different solutions to process these questions?

Both types of text have a different set of challenges. Providing two separate solutions ensures the most efficient and accurate analysis.

The main challenge when analyzing **semi-open / list text** lies in spelling mistakes and different ways of separation. The automatic analysis of **open text** is more demanding and requires the understanding of different expressions or concepts for similar topics, as well as the interpretation of sentiment and emotions.

Lets have a look at a few examples.

### Open Text Solution

- **Example**: An open-ended question from a survey: _"What did you like or dislike about your recent trip to Paris?"_

- **Example text**: An individual response to the above question: _"Enjoyed the fantastic food in those sweet bistros, although the waiters were at times a bit grumpy."_

- **Text format**: Sentences, sentence fragments or even multiple sentences including sentiment / emotions.

- **Purpose**: Broad set of use-cases, e.g. open-ended questions from surveys (such as NPS, customer feedback, etc.), product reviews, social media post etc.

- **Caplena analysis**: The AI analyzes meaning and content-related concepts, including negations, synonyms and emotions.

### Semi-Open / List Text

- **Example**: A top-of-mind brand recognition question from a survey: _"What car brands are you familiar with?"_

- **Example text**: An individual response to the above question: _"Mercedes, Ford, Toyota"_

- **Text format**: Mostly single words or short word groups, many duplicates.

- **Purpose**: Mostly used in an unaided awareness and/or top-of-mind context.

- **Caplena analysis**: The AI considers the similarity of spellings.
