# Data-Structure: Projects, Text to Analyze, Rows, etc.

## Project

A Project is the highest-level object at Caplena. It is somewhat equivalent to a sheet in Excel.

#### Survey Example:
When conducting a survey, you will probably have all results in one sheet. Every row then represents one respondent, every column to either a question or some additional data, like identifier, demographics etc.

#### NPS Feedback Example:
[NPS questionnaires](https://blog.caplena.com/2019/07/22/5-keys-to-effectively-measuring-and-utilizing-nps/) will obviously have a column containing the score (an auxiliary column in Caplena's terms) and often one column containing the open-ended feedback. There might also be multiple questions, e.g. "What did you like..." and "What did you dislike", although we recommend asking only a single question in most cases.

#### Social Media Data Example:
A social media dataset will usually have one column containing the text you want to evaluate, so you would have one column with text to analyze in Caplena's terms. But there will probably be further columns with additional information like user, timestamps or the like.

## Text to Analyze
*Text to analyze* is a text column in your data that you wish to analyze with Caplena. So in our example data, we would have two text to analyze columns, with three text comments each. The other two columns are not text to analyze columns, but can be displayed when fine-tuning or used as filters or segments when creating charts and dashboards.

## Text Comment
A *text comment* is an indiviudal data cell with text to analyze. This could be the open-ended answer from a survey respondent to an open-ended question, the product review from a customer from a review website, or in social media terms: One tweet or one post.

## Row
A *row* is the same as what it is in Excel: A row of data ðŸ˜Š. When appending additional data to your projects, you can only do this row-wise (i.e. you cannot upload a single or a set of individual text comments - all data rows in a project always need to have the same number of answers - of course, depending on the nature of the project, data cells can be empty).

## Additional / auxiliary columns
*Additional or auxiliary columns* (we treat those as synonyms) are the additional data columns that you do not select as text to analyze during upload. They will be uploaded nevertheless, but you will not be able to analyze them as text and you will also [not be billed for them](03-05-Subscriptions-and-Billing.md#credits). But you can use them in charts or display them besides your text in the coding view.
