# Credits

## Purpose 

Credits are Caplena's currency. You can use credits to pay for the analysis of your data. When buying a subscription or non-expiring credits, your account is filled up with credits that can be used instantly for analysing your text data.

## Number of Required Credits

Every text comment (i.e. one cell in Excel) costs one credit. Only the text elements in your text to analyze columns (the one's that you select during upload) will cost you credits. You can have as many other columns (e.g. numerical data, segments, demograhic variables etc.) as you like, they won't be charged. Empty rows or cells containing values you defined as [dummy](#Dummy-Variables) values will not be charged.

- **Example**: A project with 1 question from a survey or a review from a review-website and 4 rows costs 4 credits.
- **Example**: A project with 2 questions from a survey and 4 rows costs 8 credits.

### Credits for Semi-Open Questions

A text to analyze will cost the same, no matter if it is a semi-open text or fully-open one. But if you merge multiple semi-open texts into one, it will only count as one column.

### When are credits deducted?

Credits are deducted **on upload**.

> #### What about testing & mistakes?
> For this purpose, everyone gets a free trial. Furthermore, there are two demo projects in every account, which of course don't incur any costs. For other experiments just upload small datasets.
>
> For honest mistakes on upload, we are accommodating in reimbursing the credits, at least in part (minus potential translation costs which we directly pay to third parties).

### Changing & downloading data

Every row will **only be billed once**. You can change, visualize, or  download the data and even restart the analysis as often as you like.

### Dummy Variables

By default we do not count empty rows towards your credits. If you have additional dummy data in your files (e.g. -99 representing empty responses), you can define up to three dummy-values on your [account page](https://caplena.com/app/account), which will not be counted in subsequent uploads.

### Tracking Credit Usage

You can track your credit usage on your [account page](https://caplena.com/app/account) (you need to be logged in to view this).

### Credits within Organizations

If you are part of an organization, the root user of your organization is the one that will be billed for the credits that you use.
