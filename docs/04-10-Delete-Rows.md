# Delete Rows

Rows of data can be removed individually or in bulk.

## Row Deletion by Filter

In the *Topic Assignment View* you can select the rows to be deleted by using "Add Filter". You might want to delete by a specific import data or any other variable.

In the middle at the top you will see the number of records that fall into the filter - in the screenshot below 499 rows are selected. Click on this selection and the *Bulk assign* feature will open. On the top of the page in brackets next to **Bulk assign** you will also see the number of rows that can and will be treated.

Once you are sure you want to go ahead you can click the red delete button at the bottom of the menu.

## Row Deletion by Individual Selection

You can also select individual records from the row browser on the left in the *Topic Assignment View*. You simply tick the box ahead of each record you would like to delete.

To enable the delete option when selecting individual records the **grouping duplicates** function should be disabled. Please go to the **view option** feature to disable this function - just click on the little cog wheel at the top in the middle.
