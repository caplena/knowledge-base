# Upload a File

Using this option, you can simply drag and drop your data file into the import box or browse to the location of your file. The currently supported data formats for this import option are: .xls, .xlsx, .csv, .txt, .spss and .sav.

## Data Structure

The data should be arranged in columns and rows, where the rows include the indiviudal records such as respondends, reviews or social media feedback.

The first row of the data file will be treated as the column header or title. In case you have the description of your data columns across several rows, e.g., the variable name in the first row and a description the second, you should delete one of these rows or merge them into a single row.

**What does the highlighted column represent in the screenshot?**

The column highlighted in green, labeled "Reason for Rating," is the text column designated for AI analysis. This is where Caplena will perform its text analysis.

**What about the other columns?**

The other columns in the screenshot are additional columns. When uploading a project to Caplena, any columns you don‚Äôt select for text processing will be treated as additional columns. These can be uploaded alongside the text column and used for segmentation and filtering in your analysis, but they won‚Äôt be analyzed by AI. Examples of this data include respondent metadata (age, gender, customer segment, country), an ID column for identification in the export file, or responses to closed questions, such as NPS scores. You won‚Äôt be billed for these columns.

Non-text data will be displayed and can be used at various stages of the analysis process. For example, they can be shown with the text data during fine-tuning, viewed in the row browser when examining text behind specific topics, or used in charts and dashboards for segmenting and filtering results.

> To benefit most from Caplena, we recommend adding as many relevant additional columns as possible.

## Multiple Text Columns

When setting up a project, you may have either a single text column or multiple text columns to analyze, especially common in survey data with several open-ended questions.

## A Single Column

If you are working with responses to a single open-ended question (such as in surveys, customer reviews, or social media feedback), you‚Äôll have a project with just one text column. You can upload this text data alongside auxiliary data columns (e.g., ID, ratings, demographics, dates, or countries) to use in your analysis for filtering and segmentation.

## Multiple Columns

If your survey includes multiple open-ended questions, there‚Äôs no need to create separate projects for each. Instead, you can upload all your text columns in one file, as long as your data is organized with each row representing a single respondent.

For example, here‚Äôs a data structure with two open-ended questions and additional auxiliary variables:

![Bildschirmfoto 2022-05-13 um 10.58.48.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEyNDcxMw/images/Hvv5D2d33vs)

This setup is ideal when you want to analyze multiple open-ended questions from a single project. Each text column (or question) will be displayed separately within the project, allowing for individual text-level analysis.

## Merging Columns

In situations where you need to analyze text across several data cells (e.g., when several columns relate to the same answer), we recommend merging those answers in your data file before uploading them to Caplena.

Follow these steps:

- **Use Excel Function for Merging:** Utilize the Excel function =CONCATENATE(A2;B2), which merges the content of two cells into one.

- **Include a Dividing Character:** To distinguish content sources, include a dividing character. For example, use =CONCATENATE(A2;" || ";B2), where the two pipe symbols (||) act as indicators for content origin.

- **Add All Columns to Merge:** Ensure you add all the cells you'd like to merge using the concatenate function.

By consolidating information before uploading it to Caplena, you'll streamline the analysis process, making it more effective across all your fully open projects.

## Date Support

Including date columns in your uploads enables you to use Caplena for trend analysis and date filtering.

If you're using our integrations for online reviews or survey collection tools you don't need to worry about date detection so you can skip this section as it is automatically imported and detected. If you're uploading files you need to make sure that the date format is accepted. In order to be  recognized as date column, your values need to match one of the following formats:

- YYYY-MM-DD, i.e. "2022-01-30" (aka ISO Format)
- DD.MM.YYYY, i.e. "1.30.2022" or "01.03.2022"
- DD/MM/YYYY, i.e. "1/30/2022" or "01/30/2022"

![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 17.07.07.png](<../assets/images/Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 17.07.07.png>)

**Other formats may be supported**, check the sample data in the "Organize" step to verify that it was recognized correctly:

During import, all values of date columns will be normalized to ISO Format (YYYY-MM-DD) no matter which source format the values had. Timestamps will be parsed as well if available as can be seen in the second column in above screenshot.

Note that american-style dates like **MM/DD/YYYY are not supported**, convert to day-first before upload.

## Organize your data

When uploading data to Caplena, the Organize Your Data step ensures that your dataset is correctly formatted before analysis. Here‚Äôs how to use this section effectively:

![Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 17.09.16.png](<../assets/images/Screenshot 2025-02-06 at 17.09.16.png>)

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Selecting the Right Columns**

- Each row represents a column from your dataset.

- Checkboxes on the left allow you to select which columns should be included in your analysis.

- You can use the Filters at the top to manage columns more efficiently.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Understanding Column Types**

Each column is categorized based on its type:

- **Text Columns** ‚Üí Additional columns used for segmentation. Like age, region, marital status.

- **TTA (Text to Analyze)** ‚Üí The main text column Caplena will analyze. When you select an open-text column, you'll see all the columns the system detected for analysis. You can toggle these columns on or off depending on your project needs. You can analyze up to **25 open-ended columns** in a single project. Toggle the columns on or off based on what you need for your analysis.

- **Date Columns** ‚Üí Contains timestamps like 2020-10-01, 2021-02-13.

- **Numerical Columns** ‚Üí Used for values like survey waves or employee counts.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Reviewing Sample Data**

- The Sample Data section shows a preview of values in each column.

- This helps verify that the correct columns are selected before proceeding.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Finalizing Your Data Setup**

- If something looks incorrect, click Back (Re-upload File) to adjust your dataset.

- If everything is set, click Validate to confirm the selection and continue.

- If you no longer want to proceed, click Cancel to exit the process.

Once your data is organized, the Finalize Your Upload step provides an overview before completing the process.

‚úÖ **Best Practices**

- Always ensure that the TTA column is correctly identified, as this is the main text Caplena will analyze.

- Exclude any unnecessary columns to keep your project clean and focused.

- If data appears incorrect, try re-uploading the file with proper formatting.

- Review the credit deduction before finalizing to ensure you're aware of the cost.

üí° Despite having all questions within one project, the actual analysis will take place on an individual text level. All text columns / questions will be shown when accessing your project.

## View Options

Once you click on a text in the [_Fine-Tuning View_](06-01-Fine-tuning-view.md) you will see your uploaded non-text data on the right.

![Bildschirmfoto 2022-08-01 um 17.55.10.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEyNDcxMw/images/WR9GdzgJeH0)

You can also use the little cog wheel at the top right of the text display and select any of these variables to be shown underneath the text.

![Bildschirmfoto 2022-08-01 um 18.02.50.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEyNDcxMw/images/r98kKwQhPCQ)

### Filters

You will find filters in the Fine-Tuning View, on Charts and Dashboards. You will find your imported non-text data under "Additional Columns" and they can be used to filter text or results.

![Bildschirmfoto 2022-08-01 um 18.11.51.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEyNDcxMw/images/wzCdysw9cnQ)

The "Standard Fields" at the top of the filter menu are filters that are based on the coding, i.e., allowing you to filter by categories, text, review status etc. These will always be available, even though you did not import any additional variables together with your text data.

### Segments

Additionally uploaded data can be used to create segments to analyze specific types of respondents based on the variables available. In the example below, the results are shown by smart phone brand.

![Bildschirmfoto 2022-08-01 um 18.23.30.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEyNDcxMw/images/AsT34EriE4M)

The example above **shows the usage of the "standard segments" available in the "Chart setup"** which include the segmentation by sentiment, numerical and categorial values and the NPS score.

In the **main menu, "Chart settings", you can create and build any individual segment with the help of filters**. Individual segments can be edited and duplicated in any which way.
