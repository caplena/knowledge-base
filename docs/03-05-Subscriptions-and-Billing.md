## Credits

### What are credits for?

Credits are Caplena's currency. You can use credits to pay for the analysis of your data. When buying a subscription or non-expiring credits, your account is filled up with credits that can be used instantly for analysing your text data.

### How many credits will I be charged?

Every text element (i.e. one cell in Excel) costs one credit. Only the text elements in your text to analyze columns (the one's that you select during upload) will cost you credits. You can have as many other columns as auxiliary columns (e.g. numerical data, segments, demograhic variables etc.) as you like, they won't be charged. Empty rows will not be charged.

- **Example**: A project with 1 question from a survey or a review from a review-website and 4 rows costs 4 credits.
- **Example**: A project with 2 questions from a survey and 4 rows costs 8 credits.

### How much credits do semi-open / list questions cost?

A text to analyze will cost the same, no matter if it is a semi-open text or fully-open one. But if you merge multiple semi-open texts into one, it will only count as one question.

### When are credits deducted?

Credits will be deducted when the data will be uploaded.
