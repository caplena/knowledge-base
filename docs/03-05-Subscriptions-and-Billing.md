## Credits

### What are credits for?

Credits are Caplena's currency. You can use credits to pay for the analysis of your data. When buying a subscription or non-expiring credits, your account is filled up with credits that can be used instantly for analysing your text data.

### How many credits will I be charged?

Every text element (i.e. one cell in Excel) costs one credit. Only the text elements in your text to analyze columns (the one's that you select during upload) will cost you credits. You can have as many other columns as auxiliary columns (e.g. numerical data, segments, demograhic variables etc.) as you like, they won't be charged. Empty rows will not be charged.

- **Example**: A project with 1 question from a survey or a review from a review-website and 4 rows costs 4 credits.
- **Example**: A project with 2 questions from a survey and 4 rows costs 8 credits.

### How much credits do semi-open / list questions cost?

A text to analyze will cost the same, no matter if it is a semi-open text or fully-open one. But if you merge multiple semi-open texts into one, it will only count as one question.

### When are credits deducted?

Credits will be deducted when the data will be uploaded.


For all new projects or when appending rows to existing projects, **credits will be billed on upload immediately**.

*Why?* When starting out we wanted to make it as easy as possible to experiment with our app and therefore only billed on download. As the application matured, we added more and more features. At the same time your projects grew bigger and bigger (up to 400k rows üê≥). This lead to increased infrastructure costs on our side (translations, review scraping, AI training, etc.), so we had to implement rules to bill on upload in *some* cases (e.g. when translations were activated *and* the project was large *or* the source was reviews).

Over time the rules grew ever more complex, and the moment of deduction became unclear, which lead to a lot of confusion on our customers' side. Thus, we decided to simplify things: Credits are billed on upload.

> #### What about testing & mistakes?
> For this purpose, everyone gets a free trial. Furthermore, there are two demo projects in every account, which of course don't incur any costs. For other experiments just upload small datasets.
>
> For honest mistakes on upload, we are accommodating in reimbursing the credits, at least in part (minus potential translation costs which we directly pay to third parties).
