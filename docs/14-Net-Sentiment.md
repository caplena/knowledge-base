# Net Sentiment Score

The Net Sentiment Score is **based on the overall sentiment of your text to analyze**. Based on the assigned topics and their sentiment, each text comment will have an overall positive, negative, or neutral classification. The calculation of the Net Sentiment Score follows the concept of the Net Promoter Score.

The percentage of negative texts is subtracted from the percentage of positive texts, and we get a value – the Net Sentiment Score – between -100 (100% negative texts) and 100 (100% positive texts).

The Net Sentiment Score can be used as KPI to be tracked over time. It can be a great supplement in addition to the NPS or any other satisfaction measure. However, it can be used a score at its own right, and is specifically powerful when no rating-based score is available, e.g. for social media tracking or any other purely text based project.

The Insight Element below shows the total Net Sentiment Score on the left and how it is being tracked over time on the right. 22.5% of the total text feedback is positive, but 72.5% negative and will be subtracted resulting in a Net Sentiment Score of -50.
