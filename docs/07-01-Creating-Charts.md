# Charting with Caplena

In the cockpit view of any of your projects the data will be visualized by default in form of a chart. However, you can create, edit, and save your individual set of charts based on our chart library. You can download the individual charts, or you can use them to create dashboards to turn your data into a story and share them among your colleagues and clients.

## Creating a New Chart

You can create charts from the cockpit view of any of your projects. The chart menu is on the right where you will see your chart collection once they have been created.

By clicking on the "New Chart" button you will be taken to the charting view, where you can choose the appropriate chart type, customize its layout, and filter your data.

By default, the data will be shown as bar chart. Other chart types can be selected from the menu on the left. Currently there are **four different chart types available for the coded data and two chart types for visualizing and analyzing scores**, such as NPS, customer satisfaction or other averages.

## Charts Available

With the following set of charts, you can visualize your coded results and begin telling your story. 

- Bar chart
- Line & pie chart
- Treemap
- Relationship graph 

All these charts are **interactive**, which means you can **click on the topics and categories and you will see the data behind it**, i.e., the text on which the analysis is based.

All **charts are connected to the data**, meaning they are **always based on the latest coding status**. In case you make any changes to your data, all related charts will be instantly updated.

### The Working Horse

This is a highly flexible chart type that can be used for a single question or different questions combined. With this chart you can show total results as well as comparisons between sub-sets or different segments.

The following example from a NPS survey shows the coded results broken into the three NPS segments, i.e., comparing the answers between Detractors, Passives and Promoters.

### Show and Monitor Trends

The main use case for this chart is to show how your data changes over time. This could be a great choice when comparing different survey waves or in the case of continuously collected data from customer feedback systems or when collecting customer reviews from websites such as Amazon, Google Maps, Apple Store etc. using our [Integrations feature](04-09-Integrations-in-Detail.md).

The following chart shows an example of Amazon reviews of a Bluetooth speaker. In this case, the results are shown on a monthly basis.

### Hierachical Distribution

The treemap provides an intuitive overview of the distribution of each category and its individual codes.

### Relationship Graph

With the relationship graph you can innovatively analyze and visualize which codes have a strong relationship, i.e., which codes occur frequently together with the feedback of the customers.

## Visualizing Scores

With the following two chart types you can include and visualize your numerical data, most commonly scores, such as NPS, CSAT or similar types of averages.

### Score Chart

The score chart shows the average score and the distribution of the values. In the example below, the NPS is shown with the distribution across the three NPS groups, i.e., Promoters, Passives and Detractors. Of course, this can be applied to any other score such as CSAT scores or the average star ratings when using our [Integrations feature](04-09-Integrations-in-Detail.md).

### Driver Analysis

Using driver analysis you can measure a **topicâ€™s impact on customer satisfaction**, whether it is on the NPS, CSAT or your custom build customer satisfaction or loyalty score.

Our **in-build driver analysis is based on a multiple regression analysis** for measuring the relative impact of each individual category or topic on a score (NPS, CSAT, star rating, etc.). The **relative impact of the topic on that score is shown on the x-axis**, meaning that the further on the right a topic occurs on the scatter chart the higher is its impact on the score. The **y-axis shows the frequency of how often a topic was mentioned**.

Any **topic that appears in the upper right of scatter chart has a high positive impact** on the customer satisfaction score and matters to many (mentioned by many) - these aspects can be considered key strengths. **Topics occurring on the upper left also matter to many, but have a negative impact** on the score, thus can be considered key weaknesses. This chart can be a very effective tool to determine your future actions, i.e., ensure that you maintain your strengths and improve where your product or service is currently considered weak.

## Manage Your Chart Collection

Charts that you have created and saved can be accessed via the Cockpit of the project where the chart was created and stored or you can access any chart across all your projects form the chart list that you can reached via the Main Menu.

Your chart collection within the individual project Cockpit is on the right:

![Bildschirmfoto 2022-01-19 um 17.58.32.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEyNDcxMw/images/0Vs7D9DBW48)

Via the *Main Menu* you can reach and mange all your charts across all your projects:

![Bildschirmfoto 2022-01-19 um 17.57.26.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEyNDcxMw/images/AlvpXG9HMk0)

To return to the project Cockpit from the chart settings, you can simply use the back button of your browser, in case you have accessed the chart from the Cockpit. You can also simply click on the link with the project name on lower left of the menu (underneath "Segments"), which brings you right back to the project Cockpit. The latter is particularly helpful if you have accessed your chart from your main chart list or from one of your dashboards.

![Bildschirmfoto 2022-01-21 um 15.49.08.png](https://stoplight.io/api/v1/projects/cHJqOjEyNDcxMw/images/7ZoKjJZFivc)

Otherwise, you can always go back to your project using the *Main Menu* where you select Projects to return to your project list.


## Downloading Charts
Downloading a chart to your computer is simple. You have two options:

### Download Chart as Image:
When you click the "Download Chart" icon, you can choose between two file formats either PNG or SVG, giving you the freedom to customize its size.

![Bildschirmfoto 2024-01-17 um 12.45.29.png](<../assets/images/Bildschirmfoto 2024-01-17 um 12.45.29.png>)

Feel free to adjust it to your liking! Additionally, you can add your personal touch by changing the background in the Chart Settings:

![Bildschirmfoto 2024-01-17 um 12.47.22.png](<../assets/images/Bildschirmfoto 2024-01-17 um 12.47.22.png>)

### Download the Chart Data
Alternatively, you also have the option to download an unformatted Excel file that includes both percentages and absolute numbers. This makes it a breeze to copy the data right into your charting software. This can be particularly helpful when creating a chart with segments and when you apply filters, as you will have the raw data for your specific selection.
