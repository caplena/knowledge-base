# Importing Multiple Texts to Analyze in one Project

When starting a project you have either a single column with text to analyze or you have several text columns in one row. The latter is often true when analysing survey data with several open-ended questions.

## One Text Column to Analyze

In case you are analyzing the answers to a single open-ended question from a survey, reviews from a customer review website (such as Google Maps, Apple App Store, Amazon, etc.) or social media feedback, you will have a project with a single text-column to be analyzed. Thus, you simply upload your open-ended data together with your auxiliary data columns (these can be any additional variables such as ID, ratings, demographics, dates, countries, etc.) that you like to use for analysis, filtering and segmentation.

## Multiple open-ended survey questions

When analyzing survey data, you might have more than one open-ended question in your questionnaire. In such cases, you do not have to create several individual projects to analyze them across different individual projects, you can import your data all at once as a single file.

The example below includes two open-ended questions as well as a number of auxiliary variables for analytical purposes.

Using this approach makes only sense when you have your data organized like in the example above, i.e., in one sheet in which each row represents one respondent.

Despite having all questions within one project, the actual analysis will take place on a question level. When accessing your project you can enter the analysis of each question of the project.

There are exceptions when the data layout is not or cannot be arranged as single row for each respondent. One example are employee surveys, where you often want to avoid being able to trace a set of answers back to specific individuals. In such cases, each question / feedback / text to be analyzed should be uploaded individually.
