## Subscriptions

### How it works

We are offering three types of [subscriptions that should fit your needs](https://caplena.com/en/pricing). A subscription is your membership to Caplena's self-service platform. Besides all the features your can use on your own, we are offering various levels of managed support to take care of an analyze your data. Let's discuss what is the most suitable level of cooperation!

#### Duration

Any ubscriptions is on an annual basis.

#### Three distinct Offers

Our subscriptions **reflect the needs of our customers**. They are modular, building on each other and only differ in their features, that they unlock. Please refer to our [pricing page](https://caplena.com/en/pricing) for a feature comparison.

#### Billing Schedule

Your bill will always be issued **at the beginning of your subscription cycle**.

### Credits

In Caplena's world, **credits are your currency** to use Caplena's services. Check out our [article on credits](03-05-Credits.md) to see how they work.

One credit corresponds to the analysis or download of one text / feedback response. Each subscription comes with 1'500 credits per subscription month. These monthly credits are expiring at the end of the subscription month if not used. In addition, you can **top-up** your account with **non-expiring credits**. These are only deducted from your account when you use them.

If you have non-expiring as well as monthly credits in your account, the system will try to use up your monthly credits **before** touching the non-expiring ones.

### Upgrading

You can **upgrade your subscription at any point in your [account page](https://caplena.com/app/account/subscription)**, which will instantaneously unlock your new set of features. Your subscription cycle will not be changed. If you wish to downgrade your subscription, you can also do this in your [account page](https://caplena.com/app/account/subscription) as well. The changes will apply immediately as well and you will be charged pro-rata for the cheaper subscription.

### Cancellation

We hope it will never come to that! ðŸ™‚ But if you wish to cancel your subscription, you can do so on your [account page](https://caplena.com/app/account/subscription). Canceling before your next subscription cycle will also end the auto-renewal for the next cycle automatically.
