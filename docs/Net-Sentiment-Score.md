## Insight Elements Explained


### What is the Net Sentiment Score?

The Net Sentiment Score is a key metric used to measure the overall sentiment of your text data. Each comment is classified as positive, negative, or neutral based on its content and the topics assigned to it. This classification follows the same principles as the Net Promoter Score (NPS), providing a simple and effective way to understand the general sentiment of your feedback.

### How is the Net Sentiment Score Calculated?

The score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of negative texts from the percentage of positive texts. This gives us a Net Sentiment Score that ranges from -100 (representing 100% negative texts) to 100 (representing 100% positive texts).

A higher score indicates more positive sentiment, while a lower score suggests a predominance of negative sentiment.

### How Can I Use the Net Sentiment Score?

The Net Sentiment Score can be used as a KPI to be tracked over time. It can be a great supplement in addition to the NPS or any other satisfaction measure. However, it can be used as a score in its own right, and is specifically powerful when no rating-based score is available, e.g. for social media tracking or any other purely text-based project.

### Visualizing the Net Sentiment Score

The Insight Element above shows the current Net Sentiment Score on the left and the sentiment trend over time on the right. In this example, 78.2% of the total text feedback is positive, and 7.9% is negative, resulting in a Net Sentiment Score of 70.3.

The **Trending Positive Topics** and **Trending Negative Topics** sections provide insights into the most frequently mentioned topics with the most positive or negative sentiment in the dataset. These sections help you identify areas that are either performing well or facing challenges, offering key opportunities for improvement.

Each topic in these sections is evaluated based on its sentiment, with visual representation of:

- **Net Sentiment:** The overall sentiment for the topic.
- **Sentiment Trend:** The progression of sentiment over time.
- **Responses:** The number of responses related to each topic.
- **Responses Trend:** The fluctuation or growth of responses over time.

### How can I use these scores?

- **Identify areas of success (Positive Topics):** Use the Trending Positive Topics section to monitor which aspects of your service or product are performing well and generating positive sentiment. This can help you focus on your strengths.

- **Monitor areas of concern (Negative Topics):** The Trending Negative Topics section highlights areas that are receiving negative feedback, helping you quickly identify where to focus improvement efforts.

- **Track sentiment trends:** By observing the Sentiment Trend over time, you can determine if issues or positive feedback are growing, stabilizing, or resolving.

- **Evaluate response growth:** The Responses Trend indicates whether certain topics are generating more attention, which could either reflect growing dissatisfaction or increasing interest in a positive aspect.
