# Net Sentiment Score


### What is the Net Sentiment Score?

The Net Sentiment Score is a key metric used to measure the overall sentiment of your text data. Each comment is classified as positive, negative, or neutral based on its content and the topics assigned to it. This classification follows the same principles as the Net Promoter Score (NPS), providing a simple and effective way to understand the general sentiment of your feedback.

### How is the Net Sentiment Score Calculated?

The score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of negative texts from the percentage of positive texts. This gives us a Net Sentiment Score that ranges from -100 (representing 100% negative texts) to 100 (representing 100% positive texts).

A higher score indicates more positive sentiment, while a lower score suggests a predominance of negative sentiment.

### How Can I Use the Net Sentiment Score?

The Net Sentiment Score can be used as a KPI to be tracked over time. It can be a great supplement in addition to the NPS or any other satisfaction measure. However, it can be used as a score in its own right, and is specifically powerful when no rating-based score is available, e.g. for social media tracking or any other purely text-based project.
