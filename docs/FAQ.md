### What Language Should I Use for Topic Collections in Caplena?

Caplena is multilingual and can handle topic collections in any language, but for optimal performance, it's recommended that topics match the language of most answers in your project. 

If most of your responses are in English, the topics should also be in English for better analysis. In cases where your project involves multiple languages, we suggest aligning the topic language with the majority of responses. 

The chosen topic language will also be used for chart labels when creating visualizations.


### Can I analyze data from multiple markets/countries in a single project?
Yes, we recommend analyzing all markets within a single project rather than setting up multiple projects. It simplifies the process and allows for more efficient management of data.

If your responses are in different languages, you can enable automatic translation. This allows you to create a single topic collection and analyze everything in one language, streamlining the process across all markets.

By using automatic translation and keeping everything in one language, you can apply the same topic collection across all markets.

You can create a dashboard to view and compare data by market/country, which provides deeper insights into each region.

### What if I forgot to enable translations in Settings?

If you forgot to enable translations, you won’t be able to activate it on your end after setting up the project. However, you can contact the Caplena Support Team, and we’ll enable the translation feature for you. Once it’s turned on, the system will translate the responses, allowing you to analyze everything in a single language.

### Why am I getting an error saying "unable to cast column to number" when trying to upload additional data?

This error usually occurs when the order of the columns in the file you're uploading doesn’t match the data already on the platform. The columns need to be in the exact same order. You can check the data structure by looking under "Add Filter" in the "Additional Columns" section, or export your existing data to compare and see if anything is missing.

If you're still unable to upload the additional data, feel free to send the data file to our support team for a quick review.


### I need to restart analysis. Will my credits be charged again?
If you need to restart the analysis, your credits will not be charged again for the same data. Caplena only charges credits when you first upload and analyze the data. Once the data is in the system, you can rerun the analysis, change topics, or make adjustments without being charged additional credits.
