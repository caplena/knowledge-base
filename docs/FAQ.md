### What Language Should I Use for Topic Collections in Caplena?

Caplena is multilingual and can handle topic collections in any language, but for optimal performance, it's recommended that topics match the language of most answers in your project. 

If most of your responses are in English, the topics should also be in English for better analysis. In cases where your project involves multiple languages, we suggest aligning the topic language with the majority of responses. 

The chosen topic language will also be used for chart labels when creating visualizations.


### Can I analyze data from multiple markets/countries in a single project?
Yes, we recommend analyzing all markets within a single project rather than setting up multiple projects. It simplifies the process and allows for more efficient management of data.

If your responses are in different languages, you can enable automatic translation. This allows you to create a single topic collection and analyze everything in one language, streamlining the process across all markets.

By using automatic translation and keeping everything in one language, you can apply the same topic collection across all markets.

You can create a dashboard to view and compare data by market/country, which provides deeper insights into each region.

### What if I forgot to enable translations in Settings?

If you forgot to enable translations, you won’t be able to activate it on your end after setting up the project. However, you can contact the Caplena Support Team, and we’ll enable the translation feature for you. Once it’s turned on, the system will translate the responses, allowing you to analyze everything in a single language.
