You can easily enter or copy your data directly into the upload window. Here’s how:

- **Enter Data Manually:** Type your data directly into the upload window. Each line of data should be separated by pressing the Enter key.

- **Copy-Paste from Other Applications**: If you're copying data from applications like Excel, the data will be line-separated automatically when pasted into the upload window. This means you don’t need to manually separate lines; the application handles it for you.

## Additional Tips
-  **Data Formatting**: Ensure that your data is formatted correctly before pasting it. Each entry should be on a new line.

- **Compatibility**: This method works well with data copied from spreadsheet applications such as Excel or Google Sheets.
