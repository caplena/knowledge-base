# Caplenaâ€™s ChatGPT-Powered Summary Feature
With this feature you are able to **create a bite-sized summary of any category- or topic-based result** taking into account filters or segmentations applied to the chart.

The feature is available on any Caplena dashboard - provided the feature is [enabled](#your-data-and-chatgpt).

Once a chart was saved and added into a dashboard, you can click on any chart element and the *Row Browser* will open. At the top right within the *Row Browser* you will find the **"See Summary"** button. A simple click will produce a summary based on all or a suitable selection of the open text data behind it.

## Your Data and ChatGPT
OpenAI (the company running ChatGPT) does not use the data we send by API to train ChatGPT. It will only store the data on their servers for 30 days. For details, see this [article](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).
