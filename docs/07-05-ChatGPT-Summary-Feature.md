# Caplenaâ€™s ChatGPT-Powered Summary Feature
With this feature you are able to **create a bite-sized summary of any category- or topic-based result** taking into account filters or segmentations applied to the chart.

The feature is available on any Caplena dashboard - provided the feature is [enabled](#your-data-and-chatgpt).

Once a chart was saved and added into a dashboard, you can click on any chart element and the *Row Browser* will open. At the top right within the *Row Browser* you will find the **"See Summary"** button. A simple click will produce a summary based on all or a suitable selection of the open text data behind it.

## Ideas and potential Use Cases

- **Sentiment deep-dive:** Filter the chart by sentiment to explore the delights / pain points within a category or topic, e.g. create a summary across those customers unhappy with a certain feature or service.
- **NPS deep-dive:** Similar as above, but on a chart segmented by detractors and promotors to summarize their perception on any category or topic.
- **Topic deep-dive:**: Although a topic should and will express the open text content behind it, a more detailed summary can shed more lights into the topic abstraction across numerous answers.

The following example shows the **summary of the topic "Price"** from the perspective of the *Detractors* from an NPS survey for mobile phone providers:

## Your Data and ChatGPT
