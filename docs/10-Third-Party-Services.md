# Third-Party-Services

Caplena employs 3rd party services to provide a top-notch user experience. But we also greatly value your **privacy and security**. We adhere to all GDPR standards and given privacy-concerned clients like Swiss Banks and Telcos from various countries, we have put a lot of work into this area and providing transparency. We are in general very restrictive in what data we share with third parties and vet them rigorously before integrating.

Some of the below-mentioned services are crucial for the operation of our platform (e.g. Google Cloud), others are opt-out (e.g. Logrocket) and again others are opt-in (e.g. Google Translate).


<!-- theme: info -->
> We are very transparent in regards to which third party services we rely on, also if they perform minor auxiliary services. 
>
> It is important to note that **the only subprocessor** that potentially has full access to the data you upload is **Google Cloud**. With most other services we only share usage information, which may include your name and email.
