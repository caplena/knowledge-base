# Third-Party-Services

Caplena employs 3rd party services to provide a top-notch user experience. But we also greatly value your **privacy and security**. We adhere to all GDPR standards and given privacy-concerned clients like Swiss Banks and Telcos from various countries, we have put a lot of work into this area and providing transparency. We are in general very restrictive in what data we share with third parties and vet them rigorously before integrating.

Some of the below-mentioned services are crucial for the operation of our platform (e.g. Google Cloud), others are opt-out (e.g. Logrocket) and again others are opt-in (e.g. Google Translate).


<!-- theme: info -->
> We are extremely transparent in regards to which third party services we rely on, also if they perform minor auxiliary services. 
>
> It is important to note that **the only subprocessor** that potentially has full access to the data you upload is **Google Cloud**. With most other services we only share usage information, which may include your name and email.


## Google Cloud

Google Cloud is our **server infrastructure provider**. While in theory they have access to all our data, their privacy policy forbids them to evaluate, make use or retain this data in any way. It is worth noting that the privacy standards of Google Cloud are not comparable to those of consumer oriented Google services, like search or ads. In the former they act as hardware provider, catering towards enterprises, governments and corporations that have strict privacy requirements, compared to the latter, in which their business model consists of offering free services by making use of user data.

We rely exclusively on data-center regions **within the EU**, specifically the data is stored in the Netherlands.
