* **Adding topics** from the topic select list. For sentiment topics a specific sentiment has to be chosen.
* **Removing topics** from the already applied topics by clicking their remove icon.
* **Rearranging topics** by dragging the them into the desired order.
* **Changing the topic sentiment** of already applied topics by clicking their sentiment indicator.


## Reviewing a Row

A row is automatically marked as *reviewed* when you change anything on the topics. To mark a row as reviewed without making a change, either press `cmd + enter` (Mac) / `ctrl + enter` (Windows) or click the *Mark as reviewed & next* button.

> The purpose of reviewing rows is to fine-tune the AI, see [Fine-Tuning](docs/03-02-AI-assignments.md#fine-tuning).

## Bulk Assignment

In some cases you might want to perform bulk operations on multiple rows at once. To do this, either select multiple rows by clicking them while holding down the `shift` key. To select all rows that match a certain condition, filter for those rows first and then click the `Select all rows` link on the top right of the row browser.

As soon as multiple rows have been selected, the bulk editing menu opens in the sidebar.
