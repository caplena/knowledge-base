# Sentiment Topics

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Topic Properties](#topic-properties)


<!-- theme: info -->
> Check out the [ðŸš€ Migration Guide](02-00-V2-changes.md#migration-guide) to learn how to convert existing projects to make use of sentiment topics.

## Overview

**Topics**, also known as *codes, themes, classes or labels* by some, summarize what is mentioned in your text comments. Topics can have different sentiments:

| Positive | Neutral  | Negative  |
|---|---|---|
| <img src="https://raw.github.com/caplena/knowledge-base/master/docs/images/topic_positive.png" style="width:170px;"/> | <img src="https://raw.github.com/caplena/knowledge-base/master/docs/images/topic_neutral.png" style="width:170px;"/> |  <img src="https://raw.github.com/caplena/knowledge-base/master/docs/images/topic_negative.png" style="width:170px;"/> |

This means you must only create **one** topic for all three sentiment attitudes from - the AI will then automatically assign the correct one.

<!-- theme: info -->

> Note: It is completely optional to enable sentiment on topics, you can also continue to use them without sentiment.

## Topic Properties

Topics have slightly different properties, depending on if *topic sentiment* is enabled or not:

| *With* topic sentiment | *Without* topic sentiment |
|---|---|

Property | New in v2 | AI relevant ðŸ¤–* | Meaning

| **[Sentiment Labels](#sentiment-Labels)** | âœ… | âœ… | Optional sentiment-specific topic labels. |
| [Description](#description) |  | | Optional long-form description or examples. |
| [Code](#code) |  |  | Optional unique, numeric identifier for the topic & sentiment.|

<!-- theme: info -->

> ***AI-relevant ðŸ¤–** means the property is considered by the AI during training and when assigning topics.

### Category

A category is a set of topics which are referring to the same overarching theme. A category could be for example `Customer Service`.

*The category is AI-relevant ðŸ¤–*.

### Label

Concise meaning of the topic. This is what's displayed on the topic chips and is used by our AI to assign topics to texts. A good topic name should be short while still conveying the meaning of the topic in plain text. Examples for topic names are `Staff friendliness` or `Shipping Fees`.

*The label is AI-relevant ðŸ¤–*.

### Topic Sentiment

If the AI should distinguish between *positive, negative and neutral* versions of this topic. For most topics you will want this to be enabled, but there are topics like `Not relevant` or `Don't know` where topic sentiment does not make sense.

*The topic sentiment setting is AI-relevant ðŸ¤–*.

> In case **there are rows marked as "reviewed" with the topic you are planning to merge**, the review status needs to be changed first to allow enabling topic level sentiment.
>
> Use the filter to select the topic and click on "Select all (number of rows with the topic)". The "Bulk assign" window will open on the right. Under "Row review status" you enable the toggle to "Unreviewed" and then you will be able to set topic sentiment.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> #### Disabling topic sentiment
>
> When disabling the topic sentiment, the sentiment will be discarded from the topic in all rows. **This action is non-reversible**.


<!-- theme: warning -->
> #### Enabling topic sentiment
>
> The sentiment can only be enabled for topics **without any reviewed rows**. 
>
> Note: **Merging** multiple non-sentiment topics into a sentiment topics is always possible, even with reviewed rows.

> When activated, the AI will start differentiating between the sentiment versions.

### Sentiment Labels

Optional sentiment-specific topic labels, which are displayed on topic chips and charts instead of the topic label   itself. 
*Example:* `Friendly` / `Unfriendly` for topic name `Friendliness`. <br>Only available if topic-sentiment is enabled.

*The sentiment labels are AI-relevant ðŸ¤–*.

### Description

Longer description of the topic for reference. This field is not used by our AI to assign the topic, therefore make sure that the essence of the description is contained in the topic label & category.

### Code

Unique numerical identifier for a specific topic and its sentiment. This can be used to visualize and compare across studies or to trigger predefined actions based on the assigned topic and its sentiment. You can choose the code if you want to, otherwise we automatically assign one.

### Keywords

Keywords are not available by default, as our AI is designed to **learn from examples rather than rules**. This is a much more efficient process than defining various synonyms manually as keywords.

However, if you have a use-case which justifies the usage of keywords, our support can enable them for you. Please note that when enabled, keywords behave as **exact matches**.

<!-- theme: info -->

> Example: The keyword `we` would match the word `however`. You should therefore limit yourself to very few, specific keywords, that the AI couldn't pick up otherwise.

An additional feature of keywords are *regular expressions* (or regexes): You may add these kinds of expressions to a keyword within slashes, to look for specific character combinations. 

<!-- theme: info -->

> Example: The keyword `/[0-9 ]{6,10}/` would match rows that contain a consecutive sequence of 6-10 digits or whitespaces and could be a primitive template for finding phone numbers.
>
> *Note: This would also match a row with only 6 consecutive whitespaces.*
