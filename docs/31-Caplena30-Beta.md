## FAQ

### How to sign up?

The beta is currently invitation-only, you'll get an invite from us. If you're interested in participting, drop us a note at <support@caplena.com>.

### How do I access it?

Click on the banner in the live app.

### Can I use this for my projects?

This is a Beta, there may be still some rough edges and things can break, we do not recommend sharing reports with your clients/stakeholders just yet.

### Is this already the full functionality?

No, we're still building the new app. Functionality such as creating a new project, adding rows and support for brand-awarness type questions is not available yet.

### What happens to the current live app?

While we are working on the new interface, the current interface will remain as is and we'll continue providing fixes to critical issues. After the full rollout of the new interface, we'll start removing parts of the old app to reduce the maintenance effort. We will **keep the current Dashboards accessible for at least 1 year after the rollout.**
