## FAQ ðŸš€

Got questions about Caplena V3? Weâ€™ve got answers! 

### How do I access V3?
Switching to V3 is easy! You can seamlessly toggle between the current version and V3 directly within the app.

ðŸ“Œ Check out how to do this:


### What will happen to my projects?
No worriesâ€”your projects will remain accessible in both versions. Thereâ€™s no need to redo anything!

### What will happen to my dashboards?
Your dashboards will stay accessible for at least a year, so youâ€™ll have plenty of time to transition.

### Does V3 include all the final features?
Not yet! ðŸš§ Weâ€™re actively developing the new app, so certain featuresâ€”like adding new rows to existing projects arenâ€™t available just yet. But theyâ€™re coming soon!

### What will happen to the current live app?
The current interface will stay up and running, and weâ€™ll continue fixing any critical issues. Once the full rollout is complete, weâ€™ll gradually phase out parts of the old app.


### How can I share feedback?
Weâ€™d love to hear your thoughts! ðŸ’¡ You can fill out the in-app survey or drop us a message at support@caplena.com. Your feedback helps us make Caplena V3 even better!
