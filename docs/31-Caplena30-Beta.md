# Caplena 3.0 Beta

<!--TODO: Link video once finished-->

## Feature highlights

### Reporting

Fully rebuilt reports with support for quantitative variables, segmentation, trend detection, NPS driver simulation and advanced filtering.

### Topic Analysis

Discover new topics after the initial setup and continue to monitor upcoming themes in your tracking surveys and online reviews.

### Alerting

Configure alerts on changes or occurences of specific topics or get a regular digest with the most important developments.

### InsightChat

## FAQ

### How do I sign up?
The beta is invitation-only for now. We’ll send you an invite, but if you’re interested, just reach out at support@caplena.com.

### How do I access it?
Click on the banner in the live app to get started.

### Can I use this for my projects?
This is a Beta release, so there might be a few rough edges. We recommend waiting before sharing reports with clients or stakeholders.

### Does this include all the final features?
Not yet! We’re actively building the new app, so some functions like creating new projects, adding rows, and brand-awareness question types aren’t available just yet.

### What will happen to the current live app?
The current interface will stay up and running, with fixes for any critical issues. After the full rollout, we’ll gradually retire parts of the old app, though dashboards will remain accessible for at least a year.

## Feedback
We’d love to hear your thoughts on the new platform! You can fill out the in-app survey or send us a message at support@caplena.com.
