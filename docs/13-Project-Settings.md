Here, you can:

- Assign a name to your project.
- Add tags for easy project sorting in the future. (optional)
- Set the language for your topic collection.
Below, you'll find advanced settings:

- Enable translations if you wish to translate your verbatims into another language.
- Enable anonymization to remove personal identifiable information (PII) from all text comments.

## Main Language

Main language is the language in which you create your topic collection. You can choose from the supported languages in the list.

 - Caplena supports multilingual topic collections, so your topics can be in any language, and they don't have to match the language of the answers.
 
  - However, for optimal performance, it's recommended that your topics are in the same language as the majority of the answers in your project. For example, if most answers are in English, the topics should also be in English.

- If your data spans multiple projects, it's best to use the same language for topics across these projects. When translations are enabled, it's advisable to write the topics in the language into which the responses have been translated (e.g., English or German). This approach ensures optimal results and improves the service.

- Finally, the language you choose as the main topic language will also be used for chart labels.
