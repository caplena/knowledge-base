# Start the Analysis / Initial Topic Generation
Once your data is in the project, you can start the analysis. Here we will explain the inital start of the analyis, which includes the selecting whether start afresh or make use of existing topics as well as the inital topic generation process.

Starting the analysis will be always the same process, no matter whether you imported a data file or whether you used an automatic import process such as review scraping (Google, Amazon, etc.), a connected account (Qualtrics, Zapier, etc.), or our API.

When you open your project, you will see the text columns for the analysis. In the example below, you see two text columns, "Reason" and "Improvement". The button underneath the name of the text column will either say
* **Cockpit** - the inital analysis process / topic generation was done, and you can go straight into the project to keep working on it, add charts, or export data etc. This is the case for the first text column (Reason) in the example below.
* **Start Analysis** - in this case, you will enter the inital topic generation process. This is the case for the second text column (Improvement) in the example below.

Lets follow the "Start Analysis" option.

## From Scratch or not?

On the first screen, you can choose whether you would like to start fresh or not. You will start fresh in case you analyze this type of open text for the first time, and the AI will go through your text data and generates the first categories and topics.

In case you worked on similar text data within Caplena in another project or you have a topic collection from previous work as an external file, or you would like to check the templates we have, you should select "No".

In case you will not start from scratch, you will have the following three choices.

- **Other projcet** If you have previously worked with similar text data in Caplena, you can utilize any suitable project as a basis for your new project. This can help you leverage existing structures and settings to expedite your current analysis process. Even if the data is not 100% the same, but you expect a very similar structure and topics, this would be recommended.
- **Template:** Caplena offers a variety of pre-made templates tailored for different types of analyses, including basic templates for industry sectors (Insurance, travel, retail, etc.) and types of analysis (employee feedback, product tests, apps, etc.). Applying one of these templates can save you time and effort while ensuring consistency in your analysis approach.
- **File upload:** Here you can choose to import your topic collection directly into Caplena. This will help you to make use of existing topic collection created outside Caplena in the past. The file should be in Excel format and requires a certain structure, which you can see further below.

Following some more detail about each option.

### Other Project
By clicking on **"Other Project,"** you'll gain access to a list of projects you've previously created on the platform. Depending on your role, you will most likely also see the projects of other users of your organization. This means you can easily utilize the previous analyis of your team members and colleagues.

Once you've identified the appropriate project and the text column within it (procided it does have several text columns), simply click on the "Inherit Topic Collection" button located on the right side of the screen.

This action will enable you to seamlessly transfer the topic collection from the selected project to your current one, ensuring consistency and efficiency in your analysis process.

### Template
By selecting the **"Template"** option, you'll be presented with a range of pre-made templates designed to cover common use cases such as NPS studies, employee feedback, and more. 

These templates are available in both English and German languages. Simply choose the template that best fits your requirements, and remember, this is just the base for the analysis, the AI can (if you wish) create additional topics additionally.

### Upload File
And finally, if you click on **upload file**, you will be able to bring your external topic collection) into the platform. Below you will find examples for the required format, depending on whether you will apply our topic sentiment or not.

Please change the format of your external topic collection into the format shown below before importing it.

 **Topic collection without sentiment:**

 **Topic collection with sentiment:**

By choosing the most suitable option based on your needs, you can optimize your workflow and enhance the efficiency of your analysis in Caplena.


## Topic Sentiment

When the system asks if your project contains sentiment, it’s important to understand what this means for your analysis.

Sentiment refers to whether responses in your project are positive, negative, or neutral. This is often used in projects like NPS  studies or any other survey where feedback can range from positive to negative.

- If your project involves responses that can express emotions, opinions, or feedback (such as customer or employee surveys where people might express satisfaction or dissatisfaction), you should select "Yes." 

- If the responses are purely factual (such as improvement questions) and don’t express positive or negative feelings, you should select "No."

If you´re not familiar with your data, click "View Rows" on the right side of the sentiment screen to preview your responses.

## Topic Generation

After the AI generates the initial analysis structure for your project, you'll be taken to a screen where you can review and refine it.

 This structure is organized into two levels: categories and topics. Here’s what to do next:

**Step 1: Review Categories**

- **Rename:** If a category name doesn’t quite fit, feel free to rename it to something more suitable.
- **Remove:** If a category doesn’t apply to your data, you can remove it entirely.
- **Add:** If you think of another important category that the AI didn’t include, go ahead and add it manually.

**Step 2: Check Topics**

- **Apply the MECE Principle:** Ensure that topics are Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE):
1. **Mutually Exclusive:** Topics should not overlap. Each topic should represent a unique idea or theme.
2. **Collectively Exhaustive:** Together, all topics should cover all possible aspects of the category, leaving no gaps

- **Use AI Suggestions:** Look at the AI-generated suggestions on the right to remove potentially similar topics.

 **Step 3: Finalize and Refine**

- **Make final adjustments** to the structure if needed
 - **Generate More Topics:** Click "Generate More Topics" to add more topics for specific categories or the entire project.

 <!-- theme: info -->

> During each of the three stages, you'll see the Row Browser on the right-hand side. This tool is useful if you want to review the actual data in your project as you refine the structure.
