# Start the Analysis / Initial Topic Generation
Once your data is in the project, you can start the analysis. Here we will explain the inital start of the analyis, which includes the selecting whether start afresh or make use of existing topics as well as the inital topic generation process.

Starting the analysis will be always the same process, no matter whether you imported a data file or whether you used an automatic import process such as review scraping (Google, Amazon, etc.), a connected account (Qualtrics, Zapier, etc.), or our API.

When you open your project, you will see the text columns for the analysis. In the example below, you see two text columns, "Reason" and "Improvement". The button underneath the name of the text column will either say
* **Cockpit** - the inital analysis process / topic generation was done, and you can go straight into the project to keep working on it, add charts, or export data etc. This is the case for the first text column (Reason) of the example below.
* **Start Analysis** - in this case, you will enter the inital topic generation process. This is the case for the second text column (Improvement) in the example below.

## From Scratch or not?

On the first screen, you can choose whether you would like to start fresh or not. You will start fresh in case you analyze this type of open text for the first time, and the AI will go through your text data and generates the first categories and topics.

In case you worked on similar text data within Caplena in another project or you have a topic collection from previous work as an external file, or you would like to check the templates we have, you should select "No".

In case you will not start from scratch, you will have the following three choices.

- **Other projcet** If you have previously worked with similar text data in Caplena, you can utilize any suitable project as a basis for your new project. This can help you leverage existing structures and settings to expedite your current analysis process. Even if the data is not 100% the same, but you expect a very similar structure and topics, this would be recommended.
- **Template:** Caplena offers a variety of pre-made templates tailored for different types of analyses, including basic templates for industry sectors (Insurance, travel, retail, etc.) and types of analysis (employee feedback, product tests, apps, etc.). Applying one of these templates can save you time and effort while ensuring consistency in your analysis approach.
- **File upload:** Here you can choose to import your topic collection directly into Caplena. This will help you to make use of existing topic collection created outside Caplena in the past. The file should be in Excel format and requires a certain structure, which you can see further below.

Following some more detail about each option.

### Other Project
By clicking on **"Other Project,"** you'll gain access to a list of projects you've previously created on the platform. Depending on your role, you will most likely also see the projects of other users of your organization. This means you can easily utilize the previous analyis of your team members and colleagues.

Once you've identified the appropriate project and the text column within it (procided it does have several text columns), simply click on the "Inherit Topic Collection" button located on the right side of the screen.

This action will enable you to seamlessly transfer the topic collection from the selected project to your current one, ensuring consistency and efficiency in your analysis process.

These templates are available in both English and German languages. Simply choose the template that best fits your requirements, and remember, this is just the base for the analysis, the AI can (if you wish) create additional topics additionally.
