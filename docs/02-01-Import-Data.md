# Data import options

Importing data into the Caplena platform is the first step to start a new project. After clicking on the "New Project" or "Import Data" button you will be able to choose between three data import options.

## Upload a file

Using this option, you can simply drag and drop your data file into the import box or browse to the location of your file. The currently supported data formats for this import option are: .xls, .xlsx, .csv, .txt, .spss and .sav.

### Data structure
The data should be arranged in columns and rows, where the rows include the indiviudal records such as respondends, reviews or social media feedback.

The first row of the data file will be treated as the column header or title. In case you have the description of your data columns across several rows, e.g., the variable name in the first row and a description the second, you should delete one of these rows or merge them into a single row.

### Additional data
Together with your text to analyze you can upload additional data columns with text and / or numerical data, such as age, gender, NPS-scores etc. These additional data columns will not be analyzed as text and you will not be charged for them. However, we recommend uploading additional data columns as you can use them as segmentation or filter variable and they can also be display besides your text when fine-tuning.

## Direct Input
You can also enter or copy your data directly into the upload window. The lines will be separated by pressing enter. When copying the data directly from Excel or a similar application, the data will be line-separated automatically.

## Integrations
The third and last option to import data to analyse with Caplena is the direct integration of external data sources, which are mainly customer reviews from various customer review websites, such as Amazon, Trustpilot, Google Maps etc.

Here you can select reviews for one or several products, services, locations (shops, restaurants, hotels, etc.) or software applications by copying the URL or a similar unique identifier to start with the data import.

Currently available sources for customer reviews are as follows:

For each external data source you will find a guideline on how to identify the reviews that you would like to analyze. In most cases it is as simple as copying the URL, just click on any of the logos in your [Upload](https://caplena.com/app/upload) section and follow the steps behind it.
