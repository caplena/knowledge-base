# How to import data and start your project

## Creating a new project

Importing data into the Caplena platform is the first step to start a new project. After clicking on the "New Project" or "Import Data" button you will be able to choose between three data import options.

## Upload your data file

Using this option, you can simply drag and drop your data file into the import box or browse to the location of your file. The currently supported data formats for this import option are: .xls, .xlsx, .csv, .txt, .spss and .sav.

**Data structure**: There is no particular structure required when importing your data. In most cases columns with text to analyze will be recognized automatically. Before starting with the analysis you can review and adapt your uploaded data.

> The first row of your data file will be treated as the column header or title. In case you have the description of your columns across several rows, e.g., the variable name in one row and description in another, we suggest merging them into one.

**Additional data**: Together with your text to analyze you can upload additional data columns with text and / or numerical data, such as age, gender, NPS-scores etc. You will not be able to analyze the additional data columns as text, but you will also not be billed for them. However, we encourage uploading additional data columns as you can use them in charts or display them besides your text when fine-tuning.

**Size limitation**: By default, the data upload is limited to 10,000 rows at once. However, larger files are supported by Caplena. In such cases you have two options. You can get in touch with us via our integrated chat or send an email to support and we will increase your upload limit, or you can import your data in multiple batches. For the multiple batch upload, you split your data into several files with up to 10,000 rows. Once the first file has been uploaded you can add the other files by using the "Upload further answers" feature for that project.

Here's a short video showing and explaining the multiple batch data import for larger projects.
