# Languages and Translations

## Supported Languages
Caplena supports a range of languages out of the box, check out [this list](https://caplena.com/en/supported-languages/) for details.

Caplena works best on languages for which we have a lot of data, specifically Western European languages. This doesn't mean other languages won't work at all, but such datasets might need a bit more manual fine-tuning from your side.

## Auto-Translation
You can enable [AI translations](#automatic-translations) with the click of a button. Through that functionality, the application will work on practically any language.

## Topic Collection Language

Caplena is inherently multilingual and it can work with topic collections in any language and the topics do not necessarily have to be in the same language as the answers.

However, for performance reasons we strongly recommend to create your topics in the same language as most of the answers in your project. If most answers are in English, the topics should be in English too. If your data spans across multiple projects, we also recommend using the same language as most of the answers.

When translations are enabled, we suggest writing the topics in the language the responses were translated to (either English or German etc.). This ensures optimal results and helps us to improve the service.

The language selected as main topic language will also be the language shown as labels when creating charts.

## Automatic Translations

### Enable Auto-Translations

During upload, choose Yes on the Automatic Translation select menu.

### Main Language

They are translated to the main language selected during upload. We strongly recommend to set this to the same language you'll create your topic collection in.

### Language Determination

By default, the source language is detected automatically for every answer. The text will be translated only if it is not already in the main language. If you already know the source language of your responses you can supply this information in the upload by adding a column with [ISO 639-1 language codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO\_639-1\_codes). We will recognise such columns automatically during upload and utilise the supplied source language instead of the automatic detection.

You can also have empty cells in your source language columns, for these rows we will then apply the automatic detection.

### Does it cost anaything?

Fees for automatic translation services are already included in your subscription and your Ad-Hoc credits, no additional charges incur for translations.

### When to use Auto-Translation

We strongly recommend turning on automatic translations in the following cases:

1. You have a multilingual text to analyze with different languages in the same dataset (e.g. the topic collection will be in English but the texts are in Chinese, English, German, etc.);
2. Your text to analyze is in a language that is not supported by Caplena (see [supported languages](https://caplena.com/en/supported-languages/));
3. You need your topic collection to be in a different language than the text to analyze;
4. You don't speak the language the texts to analyze are in and thus require translations 🙂.

### Google Translate or DeepL?

DeepL is a newish player with very good translation quality, however only a limited set of languages is supported (click on "Supported languages" during the upload process to learn more). Anecdotally, we've found DeepL to yield a bit better results both with automatic and manual coding. If you choose DeepL and have texts in non-supported languages, you'll get nonsensical answers since DeepL will try to detect the language but fails to do so. It then takes the "closest" language - which will be completely off. We thus recommend Google Translate for studies with non-supported languages.

If you choose DeepL and you supply the source language during upload with languages that are not supported by DeepL, we will use DeepL for supported languages (and for empty source language) and fallback to Google Translated for the languages that are only supported by Google Translate. For a list of supported languages, see below.

### Specify the Source Language

The source language can be determined and specified during data upload, see [here](#language-determination) for information on how to upload with source language and its implications. You can of course also supply the source language when uploading via API by populating the `source_language` attribute of your answers.

### Visibility of Translated Texts

We allow to view and export both translated and the original texts in our app. Available options depend on the view:

#### Fine-Tuning View

Both translated and original text is visible. Switch between displaying source or translated text using the *See original* / *See translated* function on the bottom right of each text to analzye. Translated text is shown as default.

#### Visualizations

All charts are interactive. By clicking on a chart element such as a bar or tile the verbatim browser will open, allowing you to see all texts behind the selected topic. Translations can be enabled / disabled at the top of the row browser window. The source language can be seen when hovering over the translation icon on front of the text.

#### Data Export

When exporting the data, translations will be included by default. Using the "Advanced options" you can change the column position of the translated text or exclude it from the export file.
