# Export Data / Results

Exporting your analyzed data is easy, and you can find the option in three places in the app.

* **Project list** → this is your place to **export the entire project** provided you have more than one text column.
* **Cockpit** → to download the data for the specific question / text column.
* **Topic Assignment View** → same as for the cockpit, but you can also use “Add Filter” to **export any selection of your data**.

## Export from the Project List
When you are in your project list, just select the project you want to export, and under project options, you will see the download button in the *Project Actions* in the menu at the top. Here you can download the data for the entire project.

<!-- theme: info -->

> This is the place when your project contains more than one question / text column. You will export your auxiliary columns followed by each text column and the assigned categories and topics.

## Export from the Cockpit
When downloading from the *Cockpit* you will receive all records for the particular question (including any additional data you require / select).

## Export from the Topic Assignment View
When downloading the data from the *Topic Assignment View* your default download will also deliver all records for the particular question.
<!-- theme: info -->

> However, you can also select data by any filter available to export selected records.

## Download options
Now, let's take a closer look at the available download options.

* [Export Rows](#1-export-rows) - Export of the data file including the assigned topics for each record. 
* [Export Summary](#2-export-summary) - Export of the Topic Collection (or code book) which also includes the frequency / percentage for each category and topic.

### Export Rows

In this mode *all* rows will be exported, containing both the *text to analyze column* that you are currently viewing, as well as any additional (non-text to analyze) columns.

*This export mode is well suited if you want to further process the data on a row-level or store the per-row topics in your own systems.*

<!-- theme: info -->

> For very large projects with tens to hundreds of thousands of rows it might take a couple of minutes to prepare the export.

### Export Summary

The summary shows the number of occurrences and frequency for each category, topic, and topic sentiment version.

*Use this export mode if you want to visualize the overall results in another application.*

## Previous Exports

For both export modes, previous downloads are available for download during 7 days after having been created.
