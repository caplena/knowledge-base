## Download options
Now, let's take a closer look at the available download options.

* [Export Rows](#1-export-rows) - Export of the data file including the assigned topics for each record. 
* [Export Summary](#2-export-summary) - Export of the Topic Collection (or code book) which also includes the frequency / percentage for each category and topic.

In this mode *all* rows will be exported, containing both the *text to analyze column* that you are currently viewing, as well as any additional (non-text to analyze) columns.

*This export mode is well suited if you want to further process the data on a row-level or store the per-row topics in your own systems.*

<!-- theme: info -->

> For very large projects with tens to hundreds of thousands of rows it might take a couple of minutes to prepare the export.

### Export Summary

The summary shows the number of occurrences and frequency for each category, topic, and topic sentiment version.

*Use this export mode if you want to visualize the overall results in another application.*
