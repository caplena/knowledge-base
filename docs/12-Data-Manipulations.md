# Data Manipulations

* [Categories](#categories)
* [Topics](#topics)
* [Sentiment](#sentiment)

You may have already started or finished the analysis for your project, but you would like to add more data, be it from a new or previous wave or from an additional market and the like.

You can add new data to your project any time by using the *Upload further answers* feature that you will find at the top menu when selecting your project from the [Project View](https://caplena.com/app/projects).

Provided your existing data has already been analyzed, i.e., topic collection was applied, the newly added data will be automatically assigned with topics based on the existing topic collection.

This procedure can be repeated as many times as you wish.

### Data Structure

The additional data should be arranged in the same way as the original data, i.e., it should have the **same number of data columns** and they should be **arranged in the same order**. The data rows can be in any order.
