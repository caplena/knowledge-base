# Which languages are supported?
Caplena supports a range of languages out of the box, check out [this list](https://caplena.com/en/supported-languages/) for details.

## My language is not listed on this page, will it still work?
Caplena works best on languages for which we have a lot of data, specifically Western European languages. This doesn't mean other languages won't work at all, but such datasets might need a bit more manual fine-tuning from your side.

## Automated Translations
You can enable [AI translations](05-03-Automatic-Translation.md) with the click of a button. Through that functionality, the application will work on practically any language.
