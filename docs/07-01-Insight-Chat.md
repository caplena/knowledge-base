### Why Use Insight Chat?

2. Click on Insight Chat in the project menu on the left.

3. If prompted, select the column representing your score (e.g., NPS).

### Getting Insights from Your Data

To get insights from your data, you have two easy options:

**Option 1: Click on the "Next Insight" Button**

- Simply click the Next Insight button to let the system automatically generate the next key insight from your data.
- This option is ideal if you're exploring your data without a specific question in mind.

**Option 2: Ask the System a Specific Question**

- Type your question directly into the system to get insights tailored to what you want to know. For example: "*What is the most common complaint?*" or *"How do customers rate inflight entertainment*?"
- This option allows you to dive deeper into areas that matter most to you.

### Option 1 - Caplena Generated Insights

When you click on the **"Next Insight"** button, the system automatically generates the first insight based on your data. Here's what happens:

**What Does This Insight Tell Me?**

- **Strengths:** Highlight what your customers value the most, like friendly staff and good food service, and build on these strengths.

- **Weaknesses:** Identify and address recurring issues, such as punctuality or cancellations, to improve customer experience.

By clicking the **"Next Insight"** button, the system keeps uncovering additional trends, offering a step-by-step exploration of your data.

**What Does This Insight Tell Me?**

- This insight provides an analysis of topics with the highest positive and negative sentiment shares, helping us understand specific strengths and weaknesses based on customer feedback.

Let´s have a look at another example:

Driver analysis helps you understand how specific topics impact customer satisfaction:

**Impact on Individual Scores (Chart 1):**

This shows the effect of a topic on an individual respondent’s score.

- Example: Negative mentions of "Airline Perception" reduce a respondent's score by -1.88, showing it’s a critical area of dissatisfaction.

**Net Impact on Overall NPS (Chart 2):**

This calculates how removing a topic would affect your Net Promoter Score (NPS).

- Example: Airline Perception has the largest negative net impact because it’s frequently mentioned and often negative.
- Positive topics like Friendliness of Cabin Crew improve NPS when mentioned favorably.

**What Does This Insight Tell Me?**

- **Address Negative Drivers:** Focus on improving customer perception, service quality, and transparency around fees.
- **Leverage Positive Drivers:** Highlight strengths like friendly staff and comfortable seating in your communications.

### Option 2 - Your Own Insight

You can also ask the system specific questions about your data that interest you. Here's how it works:

In this example, I want to know what passengers think about sandwiches on board. Since this data hasn’t been explicitly coded as a specific topic, the system will analyze the data to find relevant insights.

To find out which country's passengers are most dissatisfied with flight cancellations in Caplena, we use the following prompt and focus on negative comments:

![Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 17.23.57.png](<../assets/images/Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 17.23.57.png>)

Here is the result we get from the system:

### Tips for Maximizing Success with Insight Chat

1. **Start with Specific Prompts**: Frame your questions precisely, such as “Which country has the highest dissatisfaction with flight cancellations?” Specificity helps the system deliver focused insights.

3. **Iterate on Queries:** If initial insights are broad, refine your prompts (e.g., “What are the top complaints about customer service in North America?”) for more granular data.

5. **Compare Regions or Segments**: Use Insight Chat to compare regions, demographics, or customer segments for a clearer understanding of trends and differences.
