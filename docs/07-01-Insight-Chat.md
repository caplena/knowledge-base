2. Click on Insight Chat in the project menu on the left.

3. If prompted, select the column representing your score (e.g., NPS).

### Getting Insights from Your Data

To get insights from your data, you have two easy options:

**Option 1: Click on the "Next Insight" Button**

- Simply click the Next Insight button to let the system automatically generate the next key insight from your data.
- This option is ideal if you're exploring your data without a specific question in mind.

**Option 2: Ask the System a Specific Question**

- Type your question directly into the system to get insights tailored to what you want to know. For example: "*What is the most common complaint?*" or *"How do customers rate inflight entertainment*?"
- This option allows you to dive deeper into areas that matter most to you.

Driver analysis helps you understand how specific topics impact customer satisfaction:

**Impact on Individual Scores (Chart 1):**

This shows the effect of a topic on an individual respondent’s score.

- Example: Negative mentions of "Airline Perception" reduce a respondent's score by -1.88, showing it’s a critical area of dissatisfaction.

**Net Impact on Overall NPS (Chart 2):**

This calculates how removing a topic would affect your Net Promoter Score (NPS).

- Example: Airline Perception has the largest negative net impact because it’s frequently mentioned and often negative.
- Positive topics like Friendliness of Cabin Crew improve NPS when mentioned favorably.

**What Does This Insight Tell Me?**

- Address Negative Drivers: Focus on improving customer perception, service quality, and transparency around fees.
- Leverage Positive Drivers: Highlight strengths like friendly staff and comfortable seating in your communications.
